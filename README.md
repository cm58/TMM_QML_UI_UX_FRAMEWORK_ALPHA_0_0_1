# Welcome to **TMM_QML_UI_UX_FRAMEWORK ALPHA 0.0.1**!!! <br/><br/>

**TMM_QML_UI_UX_FRAMEWORK ALPHA 0.0.1** is a framework for **rapid UI prototyping**, aimed at ***musicians, artists, and people working with opensource tools*** for ***sound, graphics, etc.***; and for people doing UI/UX related work;<br/><br/>

It is ***free, open source software, and platfform independent software*** licensed under **GNU 3.0**. The current vesion is **pre-alpha 0.0.1**. It will more and more abouti combining **several languages** and **environments**<br/><br/>

The framework is written by **Tiago Morais Morgado**, *independent music professional (laptop and violist active in electroacoustic free improvisation, contemporary music, and new media arts), and curator of* **Nachtst√ºck Records** *label*.<br/><br/>

The main motivation for writting this framework lies within: <br/><br/>

-	Providing an easy to use solution for **prototyping user interfaces in QML**, pretty fastly and efficiently <br/><br/>

This can be applied to: <br/><br/>

-	**A)** developing a framework for **programming UIs** for **enhancing digital media arts related apps** (similarly to what you'd do, in theory, with stuff like **Lemur** or other related apps, though you can integrate the source of all apps you are using into a single app. <br/><br/>
-	**B)** developing, on the long run, a framework for using within the development of a **composer toolbox** sort of application, for composing **instrumental music**, **electroacoustic music**, and for **developing opensource tools**<br/><br/>
-	**C)** Having a tool that can enhance the UI of environments such as **SuperCollider**, **Csound**, and **PureData**, not only by **routing MIDI** and **Opensoundcontrol data inbetween apps**, but also having a library that can **extend the features of these platfforms**, in one way. <br/><br/>

This project currently includes items such as: <br/><br/>

-	A) **Knobs**; <br/>
-	B) **Faders**; <br/>
-	C) **Radials**; <br/>
-	D) **Toggles**; <br/>
-	E) **Switches**; <br/>
-	F) **Down/up Arrow Buttons**; <br/>
-	G) **Mouse Buttons**; <br/>
-	H) Another knd of **UI/UX elements**; <br/><br/>

Current versions also includes **QmlBootstrap Framework**, and I would like to honestly thank its authors<br/><br/>

Furthermore, it includes **RtMidi Library**.<br/><br/>

This was made with love, and **licensed** under **GNU 3.0** <br/><br/>

**Cheers**<br/>
**Tiago Morais Morgado** <br/><br/>
