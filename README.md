## Introduction 

<sub>**TMM_QML_UI_UX_FRAMEWORK ALPHA 0.0.1** aims at **rapid UI prototyping**; its targetted for ***musicians, artists, and people working with opensource tools*** for ***sound, graphics, etc.*** ; aswell, people doing general-purpose UI/UX related work ; </sub>

<sub>It is ***free, open source software, and platfform independent software*** *licensed under* **AGPL**. The current vesion is **pre-alpha 0.0.1**. It will more and more about combining **several languages** *and* **environments**. We just ask you to send us all the modifications you make to the repository, so that we can check them, and eventually include them here . </sub>

<sub>The framework is written by **Tiago Morais Morgado**, independent music professional (laptoper and violist active in electroacoustic free improvisation, contemporary music, and new media arts), and curator of **Nachtstück Records** label.</sub>

---

## Main Motivation behind implementation 

<sub>**The main motivation for writting this framework lies within:**</sub>

- <sub>*Providing an easy to use solution for* **prototyping user interfaces in QML**, *pretty fastly and efficiently*</sub>

<sub>**This can be applied to:**</sub>

- <sub>**A)** **prototyping UIs** *for* **enhancing digital media arts related apps** *(similarly to,* **Lemur** *or other related apps, though it's opensource and you can integrate it into your builds* .</sub>
- <sub>**B)** *contributing to the development of a* **composer toolbox** *sort of application, for composing* **interactive music**</sub>
- <sub>**C)** *enhancing the UI of environments such as* **SuperCollider**, **Csound**, and **PureData**, *not only by* **routing MIDI** *and* **Opensoundcontrol data inbetween apps**, *but also having a library that can* **extend the features of these platfforms**.</sub>

---

## Contents 

<sub>**This project currently includes items such as:**</sub>

- <sub>A) **SVG** *and* **PNG** *based icons featuring different kinds of images* ;</sub>
- <sub>B) **Faders** *and* **Multisliders**, *which you can costumize and use with different colors and layouts* ; </sub>
- <sub>C) **Toggles**, *with different layouts, which you can use to send boolean data* ; </sub>
- <sub>D) **Combos**, *which combine some of the previous elements and others*</sub> 
- <sub>E) **Stochastic allocators**, *which  load combinations of different kinds of some of the previously listed devices randomly*</sub> 
- <sub>F) *Another knd of* **UI/UX elements**, *such as Bootstrap elements, Material Design related stuff, among other things*;</sub>

---

## Additional includes and licensing 

<sub>Current version also includes **QmlBootstrap Framework**, and I would like to honestly thank its authors. Furthermore, it includes **RtMidi Library**. This was all made with love, and **licensed** under **AGPL**. We just ask you to send us all the modifications you make to the repository, so that we can check them, and eventually include them here .</sub>

**Cheers**
