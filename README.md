# Welcome to **TMM_QML_UI_UX_FRAMEWORK ALPHA 0.0.1**!!! <br/><br/>

**TMM_QML_UI_UX_FRAMEWORK ALPHA 0.0.1** aims **rapid UI prototyping**; its targetted at ***musicians, artists, and people working with opensource tools*** for ***sound, graphics, etc.***; aswell, people doing UI/UX related work;<br/><br/>

It is ***free, open source software, and platfform independent software*** licensed under **GNU 3.0**. The current vesion is **pre-alpha 0.0.1**. It will more and more about combining **several languages** and **environments**<br/><br/>

The framework is written by **Tiago Morais Morgado**, *independent music professional (laptoper and violist active in electroacoustic free improvisation, contemporary music, and new media arts), and curator of* **Nachtst√ºck Records** *label*.<br/><br/>

The main motivation for writting this framework lies within: <br/><br/>

-	Providing an easy to use solution for **prototyping user interfaces in QML**, pretty fastly and efficiently <br/><br/>

This can be applied to: <br/><br/>

-	**A)** **prototyping UIs** for **enhancing digital media arts related apps** (similarly to, **Lemur** or other related apps, though it's opensource and you can integrate it into your builds. <br/><br/>
-	**B)** contributing to the development of a **composer toolbox** sort of application, for composing **instrumental music**, **electroacoustic music**, and for **opensource tools**<br/><br/>
-	**C)** enhancing the UI of environments such as **SuperCollider**, **Csound**, and **PureData**, not only by **routing MIDI** and **Opensoundcontrol data inbetween apps**, but also having a library that can **extend the features of these platfforms**. <br/><br/>

This project currently includes items such as: <br/><br/>

- A) **SVG** based icons featuring different kinds of images, for sending out data;
-	B) **Faders** and **Multisliders**, which you can costumize and use with different colors and layouts; <br/>
-	C) **Toggles**, with different layouts, which you can use to send boolean data; <br/>
- D) **Combos**, which stochastically load combinations of different kinds of some of the previously listed devices <br/>
-	E) Another knd of **UI/UX elements**, such as Bootstrap elements, among other things; <br/><br/>

Current version also includes **QmlBootstrap Framework**, and I would like to honestly thank its authors<br/><br/>

Furthermore, it includes **RtMidi Library**.<br/><br/>

This was made with love, and **licensed** under **GNU 3.0** <br/><br/>

**Cheers**<br/>
**Tiago Morais Morgado** <br/><br/>
