# TMM_QML_UI_UX_FRAMEWORK_WIP

This repository consists of a QML UI/UX Framework.
Currently, this is only a draft, that is not even considered like pre-alpha.

The main motivation for writting this framework lies within:

-	Providing an easy to use solution for prototyping user interfaces in QML, pretty fastly and efficiently

This can be applied to:

-	A) developing a framework for using within SuperCollider development and other OpenSource Projects
-	B) developing a framework for using within the development of a composer toolbox sort of application, for composing instrumental music, electroacoustic music, and for developing opensource tools

This project currently includes items such as:

-	A) Knobs;
-	B) Faders;
-	C) Radials;
-	D) Toggles;
-	E) Switches;
-	F) Down/up Arrow Buttons;
-	G) Another knd of UI/UX elements;

This was made with love, and licensed under GNU 3.0

Cheers
