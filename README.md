## Main Motivation behind implementation 

**The main motivation for writting this framework lies within:**

- *Providing an easy to use solution for* **prototyping user interfaces in QML**, *pretty fastly and efficiently* 

**This can be applied to:**

- **A)** **prototyping UIs** *for* **enhancing digital media arts related apps** *(similarly to,* **Lemur** *or other related apps, though it's opensource and you can integrate it into your builds* . 
- **B)** *contributing to the development of a* **composer toolbox** *sort of application, for composing* **interactive music**
- **C)** *enhancing the UI of environments such as* **SuperCollider**, **Csound**, and **PureData**, *not only by* **routing MIDI** *and* **Opensoundcontrol data inbetween apps**, *but also having a library that can* **extend the features of these platfforms**.

This was all made with love, and **licensed** under **AGPL**. We just ask you to send us all the modifications you make to the repository, so that we can check them, and eventually include them here .
